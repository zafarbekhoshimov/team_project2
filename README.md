## Email Spam Detection project

This project aims to sort out emails. The model will be trained on a dataset of emails which is divided into "spammed" and "not spammed".

## Data
The data for this project is a collection of emails. Further, the data will be splitted into train and test set.

## Model
The models in this project is developed using machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn. 
Additionally, we implemented oversampling and undersampling techniques from the Imbalanced-learn library to improve the performance of our models.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metics such as roc_auc_score, balanced_accuracy_score, geometric_mean_score, classification_report_imbalanced, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score.
